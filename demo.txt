Application Of Promise:
async and await
how to fetch the data using the open weather map Api 
some ex of async and await...

async and await:
it is a syntatical  sugar of writing the promises
it helps to make the promise easier..
syntax: async function foo(){

}
it is applicable to the functions
A normal function can be converted into async function with the keyword called async

an Async function returns the promise...

await is the keyword that is used with the async function
await helps us to wait untill the promsie are getting resolved
now await is the replacement to .then()

async function foo(){
  let res = await fetch("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all")
  let res1 = await res.json()
  console.log(res1);
}
foo();

to handle the rejection in the async and await we  have

try{

}catch(error){
    console.log(error)
}

these are error handling statement

try consist of testing Block
catch for the error handler statement
async function foo() {
  try {
    let data = await fetch("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all")
    let data1 = await data.json()
    console.log(data1);
    let res = await bar();
    console.log(res);


  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error)
  }
}
foo();
